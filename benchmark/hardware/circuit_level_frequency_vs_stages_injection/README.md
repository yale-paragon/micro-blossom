It seems like the highest frequency is achieved by injecting 2 registers

```sh
d=3, inj=0 wns: 0.081ns, potential new frequency is 100.81661457808245MHz
d=3, inj=1 wns: 0.687ns, potential new frequency is 107.37678513905293MHz
d=3, inj=2 wns: 3.25ns, potential new frequency is 148.14814814814815MHz
d=3, inj=3 wns: 1.991ns, potential new frequency is 124.85953302534651MHz
d=5, inj=0 wns: 0.009ns, potential new frequency is 95.08129450680332MHz
d=5, inj=1 wns: 0.417ns, potential new frequency is 98.91866282792837MHz
d=5, inj=2 wns: 1.466ns, potential new frequency is 110.37142890337272MHz
d=5, inj=3 wns: 0.706ns, potential new frequency is 101.82971927154234MHz
d=7, inj=0 wns: 0.025ns, potential new frequency is 76.14467488227632MHz
d=7, inj=1 wns: 0.132ns, potential new frequency is 76.77015822733667MHz
d=7, inj=2 wns: 1.328ns, potential new frequency is 84.53160592255126MHz
d=7, inj=3 wns: 0.343ns, potential new frequency is 78.03419540583943MHz
```

The functionality of all build instances are confirmed
