# Circuit-Level Various T

Explore the configuration of various number of noisy measurements.
Here we explore T from 1 to $2d$, where $d = 9$.
This graph has $2 d^3 = 1457$ vertices, roughly the same as $d=11$.
Thus, we will use the same frequency of $d=11$ to make sure the frequency of the hardware unit is the same: fair comparison.
