# Graph Examples

We use JSON schema to define the input format: `schema_single.json`.
The JSON schema can be generated and modified easily at [https://jsonschema.net/](https://jsonschema.net/).

When writing code, we can use [https://app.quicktype.io/](https://app.quicktype.io/) to generate the types definitions.
For example, we generate the definition for Rust and Scala, but other languages should be simple as well.

A set of examples is also given in the folder.
